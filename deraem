My name is Each.  I release music under the name YMGER.  This is my album, 74.
74 is meant to stand for "nanashi.'
YMGER is meant to stand for "yomigaeri."
This material is presented with a purposeful divestment of ego, but I admit to anticipating your reception of it with curious joy.

This repository is meant to be an extension of the physical release of this album.
If you're reading this and you don't own the physical record, you either have a nice friend or I gave it to you.
This is to say, I am not concerned about the digital aspects of this album "leaking" or being spread hither and yon, and I am happy to have it shared by us with us.
It's also under a Creative Commons Zero license, which is probably how art should be.
More than anything I hope you listen to this work, I hope you enjoy it a lot, and I hope you get lost in it a little.

If you don't have a physical copy and you would like one, please reach out to me on any of my socials, which are usually @ymger.noise, and/or note where it is consigned and distributed in the liner notes.
Anyway, I'll come back here every now and then to update, fix, or enrich things.
Take care of your self, by now.
